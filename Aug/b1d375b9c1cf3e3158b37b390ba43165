This means that in some instances, cases could be allocated to the wrong sub-districts. We are working with the sub-districts to clean and verify the data and where errors are picked up locally, cases will be re-allocated to the correct areas.

We send our condolences to their family and friends at this time. Our focus on high-risk patients, and specifically diabetics, continues with promising early feedback. The project ensures that when a diabetic patient tests positive for COVID-19, the Department of Health makes daily contact with them. For high risk diabetics, we also encourage admission to the CTICC Hospital of Hope in order to monitor their health. Over the past two weeks, 39 high-risk diabetic patients have been contacted, and admitted to hospital with only two deaths recorded. This is especially promising, as the background mortality for this group is considerably higher, and at least 37%. We currently still have 18 of these patients still admitted at the Hospital of Hope where they are being closely monitored. The remaining 19 have been discharged and are recovering will at home. Since the 7th of August, we have also started the phase of the project focusing on low risk diabetics with COVID-19. Since the 7th of August, more than 60 patients have been contacted by a group of dedicated young doctors, and they are being followed up daily. Of this group- 13 have been referred for a more intense follow up by a medical officer for the remainder of their COVID-19 period. This focus on those people who are at greatest risk of severe illness and death, means that we are able to intervene early and ensure that proper treatment is given. While it is still early, the results we have seen show that this focus is saving lives. The Western Cape has seen positive signs as the numbers of new infections, hospitalisations and death are declining but it remains of utmost importance that we protect ourselves and our loved ones. This is especially important if you are in one of the high risk groups, or if you are in regular contact with a family member, or colleague who is high risk. We can do this by continuing to wear our masks, practicing social distancing and ensuring that we keep up good hygiene practices such as hand washing, coughing into a tissue, an arm or an elbow, and regularly cleaning high traffic surfaces. If you are over the age of 55, diabetic or have an underlying comorbidity such as hypertension, or heart kidney or lung disease, and are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, it is important to get tested early. If you experience chest pains, or trouble breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Issued by: Western Cape Office of the Premier Distributed by APO Group on behalf of South African Government.
