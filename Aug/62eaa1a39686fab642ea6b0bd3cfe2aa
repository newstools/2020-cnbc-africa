The new cases are in Kigali (6) contacts from positive cases; heightened vigilance is required everywhere. All active cases are in isolation in stable condition. The COVID-19 prevention measures announced by the Government of Rwanda must continue to be rigorously observed, especially frequent hand-washing and physical distancing. In addition, face masks must be worn in public and multi-family compounds.  Withholding information related to contact tracing or COVID-19 symptoms, jeopardises public safety and will be punished in accordance with applicable laws.
