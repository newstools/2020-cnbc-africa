Download logo News media are invited to attend the global launch of We’ve got the power: Women, adolescent girls and the HIV response, ahead of International Women’s Day.  HIV prevention and treatment programmes around the world, many of them community-based, have reversed the global trend in new HIV infections. These achievements were driven by the determination, energy and vision of community activists and organizations around the world, momentum that has grown into a powerful global movement. Women and girls in all their diversity have played a central role. Yet, too many women and girls are being left behind in the HIV response. The new report from UNAIDS marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Fulfilling the Beijing promises for women’s empowerment and for gender equality are the key solutions for closing the remaining gaps and achieving the global goals and targets for ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.
