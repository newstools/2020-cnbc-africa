NAIROBI (Reuters) – Kenya has banned all major public events after confirming its first case of the new coronavirus, in a woman who had returned to Kenya from the United States, the health minister said on Friday. Mutahi Kagwe told a news conference the government had suspended all public gatherings, sporting events, open-air religious meetings and “all events that are of a huge public nature”. He said schools would remain open but all inter-school events would be suspended. Kagwe said the woman with the virus had had been diagnosed on the night of March 12, after travelling home via London on March 5.
