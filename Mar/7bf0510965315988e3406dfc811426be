The interview, part of a regular Marketplace Africa segment called The Profit Point, was conducted by CNN’s Business Africa Correspondent Eleni Giokos in Johannesburg, South Africa. This is the first time CNN Marketplace Africa has featured the communications industry in Africa, and APO Group’s position at the intersection of journalism and business means Mr Pompigne-Mognard is perfectly placed to provide insight into the African media landscape and the way corporations communicate.
