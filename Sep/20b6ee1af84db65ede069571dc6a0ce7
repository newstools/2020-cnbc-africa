JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) â€“ South African power utility Eskom will implement planned blackouts on Tuesday after breakdowns at a number of power stations in the last two days, it said on Tuesday. The power cuts will last from 1000 GMT to 2000 GMT, the company said in a statement, adding that any further deterioration in generating performance may require additional loadshedding at short notice.
