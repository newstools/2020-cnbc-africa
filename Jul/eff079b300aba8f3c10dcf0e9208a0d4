COVID-19 cases more than quadrupled in Malawi and South Africa; more than tripled in Kenya, Mozambique and Zimbabwe; and more than doubled in Madagascar. In East Africa, 92 per cent of working women are employed in the informal sector, heightening the risks they face of sexual exploitation and abuse due to economic vulnerability.
