KINSHASA (Reuters) – The Democratic Republic of Congo’s Justice Minister Celestin Tunda tendered his resignation on Saturday in the wake of a dispute with the president over proposed laws that would give politicians more control over criminal prosecutions. In a televised statement, Tunda did not give a reason for his resignation.
