 Zindzi Mandela – the youngest daughter of Nelson and Winnie Mandela – has died aged 59. She had been South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark since 2015. Reports say she died this morning in a Johannsburg hospital. South Africa’s foreign minister Naledi Pandor said Zindzi would not only be remembered as the daughter of struggle icons but as a struggle heroine in her own right.
