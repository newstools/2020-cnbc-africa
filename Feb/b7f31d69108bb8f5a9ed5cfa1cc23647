The Highvelders led 17-13 at halftime.  The Reds had the upper-hand in the lineouts and scrums, where they enjoyed a big weight advantage. However, the visitors struggled in general play mainly because of too many handling errors. The home scrum improved in the second half when the replacement forwards were sent onto the field.

Built on the back of a superb kicking game, strong defence and excellent counter-attacking, the Cell C Sharks won for a sixth time in Otago, outscoring the Highlanders by five tries to three in the process, with Makazole Mapimpi and Aphelele Fassi bagging two tries each.  In what was a perfect way for Lukhanyo Am and Craig Burden to celebrate their 50th games at this level, the visitors also disrupted the Highlanders’ lineouts, which robbed the home team from a good attacking platform.
