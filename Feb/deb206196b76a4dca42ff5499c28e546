Recycling precious metals and minerals from used electronics can help make today’s consumption patterns more environmentally sustainable writes Christopher Kaminker, Head of Sustainability for Lombard Odier Bank At Umicore’s industrial facility in Antwerp, hundreds
of workers wearing yellow safety vests turn up every day to recover gold,
silver, copper, lithium and other metals and minerals from towering piles of
discarded mobile phones. The company is now one of the biggest players in a new
industry that has the potential to transform the way we consume the raw
materials used in the increasing numbers of electronic devices we buy each
year. Urban mining, as this activity is called, aims to recycle some of the estimated
$62.5 billion-worth of electronic waste generated each year – about three times
the value of the world’s annual silver production[1]. Computers, mobile phones and other electronic products
use a staggering 320 tonnes of gold, and more than 7,500 tonnes of silver every
year, according to the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), a
collaboration between technology companies and the United Nations University[2]. But
beyond the business prospects, the rise of urban mining offers an example of
how circular economies can replace linear ones to transform not only the way we
consume but also the negative impact our consumption has on the planet. For decades, industrialised countries have disposed of
huge quantities of e-waste by exporting it to developing regions such as West
Africa. Agbogbloshie in Ghana used to be an area of wildlife and natural
beauty. Today, it is the world’s largest dumpsite for used electronic goods
from Europe and beyond. Impoverished families work in toxic and hazardous
conditions to recycle e-waste materials manually, which is inefficient and
often dangerous[3]. Urban mining heralds the prospect of recycling much
more e-waste in consumer countries, cutting down on traditional transportation,
which contributes to global warming. It can also recover greater quantities of
metals and other materials from e-waste than the predominantly manual recycling
process carried out in Africa, India and other developing regions. Most importantly, urban mining can help reduce the
amount of traditional mining activity in the world, an increasing amount of
which is carried out in environmentally sensitive areas and where mining
companies are having to dig ever deeper to extract raw materials. E-waste is a surprisingly rich alternative to
traditional mining – just one tonne of e-waste contains more gold than 17
tonnes of ore – and is achieving rapid cost reductions through improvement of
technologies, collection systems and growing economies of scale. As many as 17
different metals can be extracted from e-waste, including silver, platinum,
copper, tin and antimony[4].
There is also plenty of it, with the United Nations University estimating that
annual e-waste is set to more than double by 2050[5]. There are encouraging signs of progress towards a more
defined circular economy for electronics. The European Union’s revised
framework on waste targets a 65 per cent reduction in municipal waste by 2035[6],  building on previous directives aimed at
waste electronic equipment. At the company level, initiatives are in full swing.
Volkswagen is building a battery recycling plant that will support the
carmaker’s goal of recycling 97 per cent of raw materials in end-of-life EV
battery packs – up from 53 per cent today[7]. Apple
has a goal of making all of its products from recycled materials. The
California technology company has even piloted robotic tools to help
disassemble iPhones[8]. Even so, more needs to be done. Many countries lack
any kind of legislation to deal with e-waste. And even with regulations
covering the export of e-waste, the EU sees an estimated 1.3 million tonnes of
e-waste exported illegally every year. Meanwhile consumers must become more
aware of the need to recycle their e-waste in a responsible way. A report this year by the World Economic Forum noted
that a circular economy for electronics could reduce the costs to consumers by
seven per cent by 2030, and 14 per cent by 2040[9]. With more effort, urban mining could therefore become
a win-win: benefiting consumers and producers while simultaneously making sure
that our planet does not become a landfill of hazardous waste.
