Milestones for Vodacom Bulls’ Visagie and Kotze against Blues #BULvBLU Jaco Visagie and Johnny Kotze will both run out for their 50th Vodacom Super Rugby caps against the Blues on Saturday when the Vodacom Bulls return to Loftus Versfeld for the first time this season. Visagie made his tournament debut for the Vodacom Bulls back in 2015, while Kotze made his debut in the colours of the DHL Stormers in 2015 before moving to Pretoria. The Vodacom Bulls will be feeling the pressure as they are yet to register a win in 2020 but will take confidence from the fact that out of the nine matches played against the Blues at Loftus Versfeld, they have won six and drawn one.
