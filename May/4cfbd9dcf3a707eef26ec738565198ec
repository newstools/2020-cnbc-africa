Financial assistance will be provided in the form of loans on highly favourable terms and allocated as follows: Albania: €180 million Bosnia-Herzegovina: €250 million Georgia: €150 million Jordan: €200 million Kosovo*: €100 million Moldova: €100 million Montenegro: €60 million Republic of North Macedonia: €160 million Tunisia: €600 million Ukraine: €1200 million. EU assistance will help these jurisdictions cover their immediate financing needs which have increased as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Together with the support from the International Monetary Fund, the funds will help enhance macroeconomic stability and create space to allow resources to be allocated towards protecting citizens and to mitigating the negative socio-economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
