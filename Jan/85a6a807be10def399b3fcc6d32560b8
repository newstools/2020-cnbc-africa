Yesterday the United Nations (UN) announced that 2020 to 2030 is declared the "Decade of Action for Global Goals". Last year the UN Secretary General called on all sectors of society to mobilize on three levels; global action, local action and people action, the latter including civil society, the media, private sector, unions, academia and of course, Youth. Natalie Robi Tingo represents a panel of youth that's launching today in response to this call. 12 young activists from 12 countries around the world are pledging to rally and mobilize.
