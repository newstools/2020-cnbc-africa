Among the major achievements for the
continent in 2019 was the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade
Agreement (AfCFTA).  AfCFTA paves the way
for Africa to better achieve its economic and social goals by developing a
greater sense of cohesion and cooperation in the important realm of trade.  More intra-African trade will contribute to
the trading countries’ economies, and raise tax revenue to fund important
social programs in health and education, for example.  To this end, the second Intra-African Trade
Fair (IATF) will take place in Rwanda from 1-7 September 2020. The African Export-Import Bank expects
5,000 participants in the trade fair, from over 50 countries, as well as over
1,000 exhibitors, culminating in over $40 billion in deals struck. Analysis by the African Export-Import
Bank (Afreximbank) shows that one of the reasons why intra-African trade is at
16% of total African trade, on average, is the lack of access to trade and
market information. To address this challenge, Afreximbank decided to, among
other initiatives, convene biennial Trade Fairs to provide trade and market
information,  connect buyers and sellers
from across the continent and provide opportunities for matchmaking, business
exchanges and conclusion of business and investment deals, among other
objectives. The inaugural IATF2018, which was
organized in Cairo, Egypt, was a resounding success. US$32 billion in trade and
investment deals were concluded. More than 1,000 exhibitors and 2,500
conference delegates from over 45 countries participated. IATF2020 will no doubt build on the strength of the IATF2018.  The following slide show provides more detailed information about this important event. Content provided by the IATF
