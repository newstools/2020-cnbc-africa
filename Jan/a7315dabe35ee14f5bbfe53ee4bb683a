NAIROBI (Reuters) – Kenya’s finance ministry cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 5.6%, from an initial estimate of growth of about 6%, saying the move was caused by slower growth in the farming sector. Economic expansion could bounce back to 6.1% this year, the ministry said. Reporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Catherine Evans
