Download logo Somalia’s international partners welcome the statements by the Federal government of Somalia and the leadership of Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a (ASWJ) issued on 12 December.  We appreciate the tireless efforts made by the Federal government of Somalia, ASWJ leadership and other concerned stakeholders to resolve points of difference through dialogue and compromise. We believe this is an important step towards establishing a unified and stable administration in Galmudug, which will be essential in order to advance Somalia’s national priorities for 2020. We encourage all concerned to continue their efforts and underscore the importance of an inclusive process that reflects the aspirations of all the communities of Galmudug, and that results in a fair, credible and transparent outcome that is acceptable to the people of Galmudug.
