By Fifi Peters, CNBC Africa anchor and reporter Old Mutual has won its case against its axed CEO Peter Moyo. The protracted legal feud between insurance company Old Mutual, and its former Moyo resumed this morning where a full bench of judges delivered their verdict on whether the axed CEO can or cannot get his job back. The crux of the court case centres around whether Old Mutual followed its own contractual procedures when firing Moyo. Today’s court appearance follows Old Mutual’s decision to appeal an initial court ruling in July last year that declared the insurer’s  firing of Moyo as unlawful and ordered for his temporary reinstatement.

The
relationship breakdown stemmed from Moyo allegedly not acting in the insurer’s
best interest by pocketing a dividend, worth millions, from NMT Capital –  ahead of the investment firms payout of
preference dividends owed to Old Mutual. Moyo
says he was fired following a fallout with board chair, Trevor Manuel after
making protected disclosures about his use of company monies to foot his legal
bills, without telling shareholders, and Manuel’s triple conflict of interest
during the insurer’s managed separation from its London parent. The
decision is likely to impact investor sentiment towards the stock, which has
been soured by the protracted legal action as well as South Africa’s ailing
economy which has dampened consumer confidence. On Monday, Old Mutual’s share price closed at R19.07 on the JSE, down more than 16% year on year. It share price shot up over 3 per cent on the news to R19.71.
